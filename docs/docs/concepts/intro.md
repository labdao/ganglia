Plex is a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/PlexLabExchange/) designed for executing scientific workflows on a decentralized infrastructure. It supports distributed compute and storage, enabling workflows on any internet-connected machine. 

A key feature of plex is its strict composability, ensuring each tool has defined inputs and outputs for seamless integration. Moreover, every file processed by plex is content-addressed, guaranteeing traceability and consistent data sharing. Explore plex's foundational concepts below:

* [Data](data.md)
* [Tools](tools.md)
* [Input / Output](io.md)
* [Records](records.md)
