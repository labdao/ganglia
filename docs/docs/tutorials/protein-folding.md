## Protein folding in silico

In this tutorial we perform protein folding with **plex**.

There are multiple reasons we believe plex is a new standard for computational biology üß´:
1. with a simple python interface, running containerised tools with your data is only a few commands away
2. the infrastructure of the compute network is fully open source - use the public network or work with us to set up your own node
3. every event on the compute network is tracked - no more results are lost in an interactive compute session. You can base your decisions and publications on fully reproducible results.
4. we made adding new tools to the network as easy as possible - moving your favorite tool to plex is one JSON document away.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through an example of how to use plex to predict a protein's 3D structure using [ColabFold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01488-1). We will use the sequence of the Streptavidin protein for this demo.

We will also walk through the process of minting a ProofOfScience NFT. These tokens represent on-chain, verifiable records of the compute job and its input/output data. This enables reproducible scientific results.

Then, create a directory where we can save our project files.


```python
import os

cwd = os.getcwd()
!mkdir project

dir_path = f"{cwd}/project"
```

## Download protein sequence

We'll download a `.fasta` file containing the sequence of the protein we want to fold. Here, we're using the sequence of Streptavidin.




```python
!wget https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P22629.fasta -O {dir_path}/P22629.fasta # Streptavidin
```

## Fold the protein

With the sequence downloaded, we can now use ColabFold to fold the protein.




```python
from plex import CoreTools, plex_init

fasta_local_filepaths = [f"{dir_path}/P22629.fasta"]

initial_io_cid = plex_init(
    CoreTools.COLABFOLD_MINI.value,
    sequence=fasta_local_filepaths
)
```

    plex init -t QmcRH74qfqDBJFku3mEDGxkAf6CSpaHTpdbe1pMkHnbcZD -i {"sequence": ["/content/project/P22629.fasta"]} --scatteringMethod=dotProduct
    Plex version (v0.8.4) up to date.
    Pinned IO JSON CID: QmZgLQypfjvK9kTsqLXwbNRiFifEU5CC7eduWWPbminybi


This code initiates the folding process. We'll need to run it to complete the operation.


```python
from plex import plex_run

completed_io_cid, completed_io_filepath = plex_run(initial_io_cid, dir_path)
```

After the job is complete, we can retrieve and view the results. The state of each object is written in a JSON object. Every file has a unique content-address.




```python
import json

with open(completed_io_filepath, 'r') as f:
  data = json.load(f)
  pretty_data = json.dumps(data, indent=4, sort_keys=True)
  print(pretty_data)
```

The results can also be viewed using an IPFS gateway. Below, the state of the IO JSON is read using the ipfs.io gateway.

**Note:** Depending on how long it takes for the results to propagate to the ipfs.io nodes, the data may not be available immediately. The results can also be viewed on IPFS Desktop or by accessing IPFS through the Brave browser (ipfs://completed_io_cid)


```python
print(f"View this result on IPFS: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{completed_io_cid}")
```
