## RME-designer

This model generates protein binder sequences based on a user prompt. The prompt consists of the sequence of the binder and the sequence of the target separated by a semicolon. Unknown amino acids are marked with an X. Protein binders are generated by combining a conditional protein structure diffusion model (RFDiffusion) with an inverse folding model (ProteinMPNN). Proposed binder sequences are further optimised using a masked protein language model (ESM2). After generation, candidates are evaluated using a protein folding model (AF multimer via Colabfold) and a physics based prediction of protein binding affinity (Prodigy). The model's output is a set of candidate binders that are summarised in a .csv table together with matching protein structures for each candidate as .pdb files.
